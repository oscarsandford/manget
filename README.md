# manget

A CLI tool for binding digital pages of manga from MangaDex to PDFs for offline reading.

## Usage

The following example shows how to bind chapter 5 of the test manga in the Polish language to a PDF. Note that as of now, the value "test" is arbitrary and set in the program. In the future, we will have an option to search for a manga title and then select which chapters the user wants from manga.
```
manget test -c 5 -l "pl"
```
